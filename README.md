# Diabetes_Predictor

This repository contains files for Diabetes prediction

# Project Overview:

In this project, I developed a machine learning model designed to predict the presence of diabetes in patients. The model used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, and I focused on preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy.

# Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project were to:
    - Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict diabetes.
    - Apply machine learning techniques to a real-world health problem.

# Learnings and Implementation:

Through this project, I enhanced my machine learning skills, particularly in data handling, preprocessing, and model evaluation. I learned how to effectively use Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for these tasks. Additionally, implemented the Support Vector Machine algorithm and performed feature scaling, which were crucial for achieving high accuracy in your predictions.
